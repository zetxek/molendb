# So... what is this? #

This project lets you check the closest windmill to a given point, in The Netherlands.

## Why?!

Just because. And because I was moving from one apartment to Amsterdam to another, and I was curious about which place would have a windmill closer (https://twitter.com/zetxek/status/865320654786220037). It turned to be the 1st apartment!
